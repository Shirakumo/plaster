;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package allows you to interact with a
;; plaster paste service directly from within
;; Emacs.
;;
;; By default this package uses the service at
;;   https://plaster.tymoon.eu
;; However, you can also configure your own setup
;; if you so desire. The Plaster server app can
;; be obtained at
;;   https://github.com/Shirakumo/plaster
;;
;; The following commands are available:
;;
;; - plaster-login
;;     If you have a plaster account, use this
;;     to log yourself in.
;; - plaster-visit
;;     Opens an existing paste in a buffer
;; - plaster-paste-buffer
;;     Pastes the current buffer to a new paste
;; - plaster-paste-region
;;     Pastes the current region to a new paste
;; - plaster-new
;;     Opens a new buffer for a new paste
;; - plaster-annotate                    (C-x C-a)
;;     Create an annotation for the current paste
;; - plaster-save                        (C-x C-s)
;;     Save the current buffer as a paste
;; - plaster-delete                      (C-x C-k)
;;     Delete the current buffer's paste
;;
;; The keybindings mentioned are only active in
;; plaster-mode buffers.
